            <h1>Course Description</h1>
            <p>This is a project-oriented class and the primary goal is to provide you with foundations for doing cutting-edge research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). </p>
            <p>By the end of this class, you are expected to be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand different paradigms and concepts of NLP</li>
                <li>Get used to reading and understanding recent NLP papers</li>
                <li>Implement some core concepts and techniques</li>
                <li>Be able to replicate/conduct recent NLP studies</li>
                <li>Communicate in written and spoken English about NLP+ML research</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Why take this class?</h2>
            You want to take this class if you are:
            <ul>
                <li>Interested in machine learning and natural language processing</li>
                <li>Fascinated by human language and intelligence</li>
                <li>Use ChatGPT and are curious about how it works</li>
                <li>Interested in getting into NLP research</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Course Prerequisite</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>You need to have good programming skills in Python for replication/modification of recent NLP research.</li>
                <li>We assume that you have a basic understanding of ML concepts. While it is possible to take CS475 without having taken CS376 or any other undergraduate ML course, we expect you to be familiar with concepts such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, train vs test data, clustering vs classification, accuracy/precision/recall, overfitting, SVM, random forest, and core deep learning techniques like backpropagation etc. You can learn these concepts as we go along, but you may find some lectures and papers difficult to understand if you do not put in extra time to learn these concepts.</li>
                <li>This class uses Pytorch/NumPy for most of the coding projects/assignments. While TA support will be provided for all the assignments, it is still recommended you be familiar with PyTorch and have some experience beforehand.</li>
            </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>There will be five assignments designed to help you understand some core concepts of Deep Learning and NLP. The assignments usually involve implementing some core algorithm/technique from scratch or doing some basic calculations by hand.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The details of the assignments will be released very soon.</li>

                        <p>You will form teams of <em>three or four</em>, and as a team, you have to come up with a creative research question of your own and then execute it.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>How do you come up with a creative research question?</strong></p>
                    
                        <p>— Well, there are a lot of ways, including but not limited to:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be curious and skeptic. Ask a lot of questions in the class! Some of the questions you will ask will not have definite answers as the NLP field is moving so fast, and that can be a great starting point for a class project.</li>
                            <li>Read recent NLP papers and build on top of it. This is another way to come up with research questions (but not always the best). Think about how you can improve something, how one idea can be applied in another setting etc.</li>
                            <li>If you still need help coming up with research questions, talk to the staff! We will guide you.</li>

            <h2>Course Policy</h2>
        
            <p>While we encourage collaboration between students in CS475, students must complete their individual assignments and homeworks on their own (discussing problem-solving strategies, resources, and group study is allowed; however, each student must make their own submissions). Plagiarism is not allowed under any circumstances (group projects and assignments) and we might use plagiarism detection tools to check for cheating in assignments.</p>
        
            <h3>LLM Policy</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>We allow and encourage students to use AI-based tools, including large language models, but we require that students list the tools used and describe in detail how the tools are used. A more specific explanation of the policy will be given in class. Anyone not following this policy will be penalized, up to and including an F in the class.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Late Policy</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>All deadlines in this class are at 23:59 (GMT+9) on the stated date in the course calendar.</li>
                <li>Every student affords 3 late days to use. You can use the late days for all homeworks and the final report. For the final report, the late days will be deducted from each individual member of the team.</li>
                <li>Past three late days, 20% score will be deducted from your assignment/report score for each additional late day.</li>
